This project is an insurance platform.

In this project, users can choose the insurance policy they prefer (on the car, home, damage, etc.).

A fungible token (ERC-20) created through a smart contract (without standard) is used for payments.

I developed this platform using:
-ganache
-truffle
-MongoDb (Robo3t)
-solidity
-web3.py
